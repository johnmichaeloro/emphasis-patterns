//I'm probably going to need the same functionality from the PatternList.
//I will have entriese for the different types of patterns.
//How do I pull this list of types of patterns?
//I will pull the pattern types just like I pulled thee entries in PatternList.
//For each patteren type, I will have an entry appeaer on the page consisting of a pattern title, a colored example, as well as a description that trails off.
//The user will be able to click anywhere on the entry to be taken to a modified version of the patternlist. This list will contain all of the patterns of the specific type.
//I will need to modify the get all patterns function in pattern container so it calls this index.

//IN THE SERVER FILE
//I need to alter the pattern schema so that things are required and unique.
//I also need to add a user model and a login option.
